## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- VanillaJS

### What I learned

- This project helped me to better understand how Flexbox works, when to use it, and when it's best to write your own custom CSS.
- I also learned the real value of using a CSS Reset stylesheet ;)

### Continued development

I built this using VanillaJS, but I intend to learn React once I've nailed down the fundamentals.

### Useful resources
